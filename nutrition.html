        <h1>Nutrition Basics</h1>
        <p>Understanding nutrition is the foundation of a healthy diet. Learn about the essential nutrients your body needs.</p>

        <div class="article-card">
            <h2>Macronutrients: The Big Three</h2>
            <h3>Carbohydrates</h3>
            <p>
                Carbohydrates are the body's main source of energy, providing fuel for physical activity and essential functions.
                They are categorized into two types: simple and complex carbohydrates. 
                Simple carbs, found in sugars and processed foods, can cause quick spikes in blood sugar and energy. 
                In contrast, complex carbohydrates, which include whole grains, legumes, fruits, and vegetables, are rich in fiber and take longer to digest. 
                This not only provides a more stable source of energy but also supports digestive health and aids in maintaining a healthy weight. 
                Aim to fill your plate primarily with complex carbs while limiting added sugars and refined grains.
            </p>

            <h3>Proteins</h3>
            <p>
                Proteins play a crucial role in building and repairing tissues, supporting immune function, and serving as building blocks for muscles, bones, skin, and hormones. 
                They are made up of amino acids, some of which are essential, meaning they must be obtained from your diet. 
                Excellent sources of protein include lean meats like chicken and turkey, fish, beans, lentils, tofu, dairy products, and nuts. 
                It is beneficial to incorporate a variety of protein sources into your meals to ensure adequate intake of all essential amino acids, particularly for those following vegetarian or vegan diets.
            </p>

            <h3>Fats</h3>
            <p>
                Fats are vital for numerous bodily functions, including hormone production, nutrient absorption, and maintaining cell structure.
                They are also a concentrated source of energy. 
                It is important to distinguish between healthy fats and unhealthy fats. 
                Healthy fats, such as monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats found in avocados, nuts, seeds, and olive oil, contribute to heart health and brain function. 
                Conversely, trans fats and excessive saturated fats, often found in processed foods, should be minimized to reduce the risk of heart disease. 
                Including healthy fats in moderation is key to a balanced diet.
            </p>

            <h4>By understanding and incorporating these macronutrients into your meal planning, you can promote overall health, support fitness goals, and maintain balanced energy levels throughout the day.</h4>

            <h2>Micronutrients: Vitamins and Minerals</h2>
            <p>These are needed in smaller quantities but are crucial for various bodily functions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Vitamin C:</strong> Supports immune function (citrus fruits, bell peppers)</li>
                <li><strong>Calcium:</strong> Important for bone health (dairy, leafy greens)</li>
                <li><strong>Iron:</strong> Essential for blood health (red meat, beans, spinach)</li>
                <li><strong>Vitamin D:</strong> Supports bone health and immunity (sunlight, fatty fish)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="article-card">
            <h2>Hydration: The Forgotten Nutrient</h2>
            <p>Water is essential for nearly every bodily function. Aim for 8-10 glasses per day, more if you're active.</p>
            <p>Signs of dehydration include fatigue, headaches, and dark urine.</p>
