        <h1>Nutrition Basics</h1>
        <p>Understanding nutrition is the foundation of a healthy diet. Learn about the essential nutrients your body needs.</p>

        <div class="article-card">
            <h2>Macronutrients: The Big Three</h2>
            <h3>Carbohydrates</h3>
            <p>
                Carbohydrates are the body's primary energy source. They are divided into simple and complex types. Complex carbohydrates, such as whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, provide sustained energy and are rich in fiber, which supports digestive health. Limit simple sugars and refined grains to maintain stable energy levels.
            </p>

            <h3>Proteins</h3>
            <p>
               Proteins are essential for building and repairing tissues, supporting immune function, and serving as building blocks for muscles and hormones. Include a variety of protein sources in your diet, such as lean meats, fish, beans, lentils, and nuts, to ensure adequate intake of essential amino acids.
            </p>

            <h3>Fats</h3>
            <p>
                Fats are important for hormone production, nutrient absorption, and maintaining cell structure. Focus on healthy fats like those found in avocados, nuts, seeds, and olive oil, while minimizing unhealthy trans fats and excessive saturated fats from processed foods. Moderation is key for balanced nutrition.
            </p>

            <h4>By understanding and incorporating these macronutrients into your meal planning, you can promote overall health, support fitness goals, and maintain balanced energy levels throughout the day.</h4>

        <div class="article-card">
            <h2>Micronutrients: Vitamins and Minerals</h2>
            <p>These are needed in smaller quantities but are crucial for various bodily functions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Vitamin C:</strong> Supports immune function (citrus fruits, bell peppers)</li>
                <li><strong>Calcium:</strong> Important for bone health (dairy, leafy greens)</li>
                <li><strong>Iron:</strong> Essential for blood health (red meat, beans, spinach)</li>
                <li><strong>Vitamin D:</strong> Supports bone health and immunity (sunlight, fatty fish)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="article-card">
            <h2>Hydration: The Forgotten Nutrient</h2>
            <p>Water is essential for nearly every bodily function. Aim for 8-10 glasses per day, more if you're active.</p>
            <p>Signs of dehydration include fatigue, headaches, and dark urine.</p>
