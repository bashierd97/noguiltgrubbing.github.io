        <h1>Healthier Entree Substitutions</h1>
        <p>Making small changes to your meals can lead to significant health benefits. Here are some delicious and fulfilling entree substitutions that you can easily incorporate into your cooking:</p>

        <div class="article-card">
            <h2>1. Quinoa for Rice</h2>
            <p>Quinoa is a complete protein and provides more fiber and nutrients than white rice. Use it as a base for stir-fries or salads.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="article-card">
            <h2>2. Zucchini Noodles for Pasta</h2>
            <p>Swap traditional pasta with spiralized zucchini (zoodles) for a low-calorie, nutrient-rich alternative that adds more vegetables to your meal.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="article-card">
            <h2>3. Cauliflower Steaks for Meat</h2>
            <p>Grilled or roasted cauliflower steaks can be a hearty and satisfying vegetarian alternative to meat dishes, loaded with flavor and nutrients.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="article-card">
            <h2>4. Chickpeas for Ground Meat</h2>
            <p>Use mashed chickpeas in recipes like tacos or burgers for a protein-packed, plant-based replacement that is both fulfilling and delicious.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="article-card">
            <h2>5. Portobello Mushrooms for Burger Patties</h2>
            <p>Grilled portobello mushrooms make a great alternative to beef burgers, offering a rich flavor and meaty texture without the added calories.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="article-card">
            <h2>6. Sweet Potatoes for Regular Potatoes</h2>
            <p>Sweet potatoes are higher in vitamins and fiber compared to regular potatoes. Use them in casseroles, fries, or as a mashed side dish.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="article-card">
            <h2>7. Greek Yogurt for Sour Cream</h2>
            <p>Use Greek yogurt as a creamy topping or ingredient in recipes instead of sour cream. Itâ€™s lower in fat and higher in protein.</p>
