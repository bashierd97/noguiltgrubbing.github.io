        </div>

        <div class="article-card">

        <div class="article-card">
            <h2>3. Cauliflower Steaks for Meat</h2>

            <p>Use mashed chickpeas in recipes like tacos or burgers for a protein-packed, plant-based replacement that is both fulfilling and delicious.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="article-card">
            <h2>5. Portobello Mushrooms for Burger Patties</h2>

        <div class="article-card">
            <h2>7. Greek Yogurt for Sour Cream</h2>
            <p>Use Greek yogurt as a creamy topping or ingredient in recipes instead of sour cream. Itâ€™s lower in fat and higher in protein.</p>
